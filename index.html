The transp-imas-translator project is developing translation software that converts TRANSP output data to the IMAS format and data in the IMAS format to TRANSP input data.

<p>

Translation is done as preprocessing by the application imas2transp and as postprocessing by the application transp2imas.

<p>

<del>The data currently translated is a subset of the IMAS IDSs <a href="./equilibrium.html">equilibrium</a>, <a href="./core_profiles.html">core_profiles</a>, <a href="./core_transport.html">core_transport</a> and <a href="./nbi.html">nbi</a>, respectively. Where there is redundancy between the first two, TRANSP stores the data in the equilibrium IDS.</del>

<p>

We will no longer manually update the html tables for each IDS showing which pieces of data that are currently translated. Run the translator and if data you need is missing, open an issue on GitHub!
