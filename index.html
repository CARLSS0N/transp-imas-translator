The transp-imas-translator project is developing translation software that converts TRANSP output data to the IMAS format and data in the IMAS format to TRANSP input data.

<p>

Translation is done as preprocessing by the application imas2transp and as postprocessing by the application transp2imas.

<p>

The data currently translated is a subset of the IMAS IDSs <a href="./equilibrium.html">equilibrium</a>, <a href="./core_profiles.html">core_profiles</a> and <a href="./nbi.html">nbi</a>, respectively. Where there is redundancy between the former two, TRANSP stores the data in the equilibrium IDS.
