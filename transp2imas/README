The application transp2imas converts a TRANSP NetCDF output file, aided 
by information and data from the namelist file, to data in an IMAS tree. 
To use it, do the following:

1. Edit Makefile as needed
2. Type "make"
3. Type "./transp2imas 38601I02"

In this case transp2imas uses the namelist 38530B10TR.DAT to convert the 
output data in 38601I02.CDF to the files ids_3860001.tree, 
ids_3860001.datafile and ids_3860001.characteristics in the directory 
$MDSPLUS_TREE_BASE_0 .


The code has so far been tested and confirmed to work with gcc-4.8.3
and version 3.7.0 of the IMAS library (the default "module add imas"
versions) on the ITER cluster. However, it only works with the manually
built, unoptimized library, without memory debugging(Makefile) or with
memory debugging enabled (Makefile.debug). When linked with the module
library (Makefile.module), transp2imas seg faults, possibly due to the
module library being compiled with too much optimzation.

To work properly transp2imas must thus currently be built with either
Makefile or Makefile.debug, linking with the manually built, without
optimzation (-O0, minus oh zero), IMAS 3.7.0 library.
