The application transp2imas converts a TRANSP NetCDF output file, aided 
by information and data from the namelist file, to data in an IMAS tree. 
To use it, do the following:

1. Copy the files 38530B17TR.DAT and 38530B17.CDF to this directory
2. Edit Makefile as needed
3. Type "make"
4. Type "./transp2imas 38530B17"

In this case transp2imas uses the namelist 38530B17TR.DAT to convert the 
output data in 38530B17.CDF to the files ids_3850030.tree, 
ids_3850030.datafile and ids_3850030.characteristics in the directory 
$MDSPLUS_TREE_BASE_0 .

The code has so far been tested and confirmed to work with gcc-4.8.3
and version 3.7.0 of the IMAS library (the default "module add imas"
versions) on the ITER cluster. However, it only works with the manually
built, unoptimized library, without memory debugging(Makefile) or with
memory debugging enabled (Makefile.debug). When linked with the module
library (Makefile.module), transp2imas seg faults, possibly due to the
module library being compiled with too much optimzation.

To work properly transp2imas must thus currently be built with either
Makefile or Makefile.debug, linking with the manually built, without
optimzation (-O0, minus oh zero), IMAS 3.7.0 library.
